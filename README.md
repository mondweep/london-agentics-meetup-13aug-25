- **Transport**: Mix of car and train depending on destination
- **Preferences**: 5-minute threshold for train connections, Google Maps integration
- **Scenario**: Critical alerts for station access during rush hour disruptions

## 🔧 API Endpoints

```bash
# Health & System
GET  /health                           # Service health check
GET  /api/demo/system-status          # Live monitoring dashboard

# Trip Management  
GET  /api/trips?userId={id}           # List user trips
POST /api/trips                       # Create new trip
PUT  /api/trips/{id}                  # Update trip
DELETE /api/trips/{id}                # Delete trip

# Traffic Monitoring
GET  /api/trips/{id}/traffic          # Current traffic status
POST /api/trips/{id}/monitor          # Start monitoring job
GET  /api/trips/{id}/alerts           # Alert history

# Demo Utilities
POST /api/demo/create-demo-user       # Create Alex or Chloe
POST /api/demo/start-monitoring-all   # Begin monitoring all trips
