# Pre-Route Demo Guide

## 🚗 Hierarchical Swarm Implementation Demonstration

This document outlines the completed Pre-Route traffic monitoring application, built using a hierarchical swarm coordination approach with specialized agents working together to deliver a comprehensive solution.

### 🏗️ System Architecture

The application follows a three-tier architecture with sophisticated mock integrations:

```
Frontend (HTML/JS) ↔ Express API Server ↔ Mock Traffic APIs
                               ↓
                        Background Monitoring Jobs
                               ↓
                        Proactive Alert System
```

### 📋 Completed Components

#### ✅ Backend Infrastructure
